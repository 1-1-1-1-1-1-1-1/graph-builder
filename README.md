### Brief description
<a id="brief-description"></a>

A tool (GUI) for

 - the build of graphs of mathematical functions (ℝ $\to$ ℝ), including
      + interpolation (with the GUI at Tk/Tcl-window!),
	  + solving the system of linear equations (SLE's),
	  + etc., in addition.

✅ Contains the tools to build graphs, integrate, interpolate, solve the system of LAEs.

✔️ Few tools in addition.

🚀🤔✔️ Was developed for the OS Windows (and tested on Win. 10), might not work on another systems.
 ❗🧐 Probably, might work on Mac, the `key_bindings` file may be modified in order to set the appropriate key bindings.
